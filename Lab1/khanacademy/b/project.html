        Why does everyone <strong><em>love </em>Istanbul</strong> ? <br>
<strong>Istanbul - the pearl of the Bosphorus.</strong> <br>
This could not but affect the architecture of the city. Here you can find majestic religious buildings, fortifications. The buildings of the Roman and Greek periods have been preserved in the Old Town. Unusual atmosphere, extraordinary beauty - that's what this city is loved for! </p>
<h3>TOP 5 interesting places in Istanbul:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Suleymaniye Mosque (Süleymaniye Camii)</strong></li>
    <p1>Incredibly beautiful and the most majestic mosque in Istanbul!
        Fans of the TV series "Magnificent Century" know firsthand about this place.
        The road to the mosque is not easy, but the grandeur of its architecture and the beautiful view of the Bosphorus and the city fully justify the effort spent on lifting.</p1>

    <li><strong>Arnavutköy</strong></li>
    <p2>"Houses in flowers — flowers in houses" is definitely about the Arnavutköy district — one of the most beautiful places in Istanbul. It is not for nothing that it is called "Turkish San Francisco". In Arnavutkey you will not find historical sights, but you will fully enjoy the sea breeze, a leisurely walk along the embankment with a view of yachts and the Bosphorus.</p2> <br>

    <li><strong>Bosphorus Strait (Istanbul Boğazı)</strong></li>
    <p3>The Bosphorus Strait is the soul of Istanbul. If I had only 1 day in Istanbul, then I would certainly allocate a few hours for a boat trip, because a wonderful view opens from the water, and the beauty of Istanbul appears in a completely different perspective.
        A mixture of architectural styles of houses, palaces, mosques, accompanied by white-winged gulls (and all this over a cup of fragrant tea with oriental sweets).</p3> <br>

    <li><strong>Dolmabahce Palace (Dolmabahçe sarayı)</strong></li>
    <p4>Dolmabahce Palace is one of the business cards of Istanbul. The openwork building with rich interiors and a well-kept garden in its architectural design resembles the luxurious palaces of European monarchs. In addition to the magnificent interior decoration of the palace, I want to note the beautiful view of the Bosphorus through the openwork gates, which complements the overall picture of the place like a cherry on the cake. If some of the places in Istanbul can still be sacrificed due to limited time, then Dolmabahce Palace is definitely worth a visit!</p4> <br>

    <li><strong>Topkapi Palace</strong></li>
    <p5>In the old days, it was the main palace of the Ottoman Empire and the residence of its sultans, in particular, the well-known Suleiman the Magnificent and his concubine Roksolana. In the palace you will be able to see the former luxury of the sultan's life, to consider the elements of everyday life of those times. For example, a collection of porcelain, which occupies the third largest place in the world. The "cherry" on the cake will be a terrace with an amazing view of the Bosphorus and the city.</p5> <br>
