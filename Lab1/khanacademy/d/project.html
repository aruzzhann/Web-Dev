        <p>Hello everyone!<br><br>A common mistake I see a lot in photography is when photos have crooked horizons. Sometimes images are tilted intentionally for a unique composition. This is absolutely different than it is when a photographer just isnâ€™t paying a lot of attention to the surroundings of their photo, and not just the main subject.
