        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <em> Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <em>Thankfully</em>, we are born <strong>to learn.</strong><br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling. </strong><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each <em>wrong</em> answer making your brain a little bit stronger. </strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for <em>growing</em>. And you <em>keep going.</em><br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <strong>You just don’t get it, yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong> Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
